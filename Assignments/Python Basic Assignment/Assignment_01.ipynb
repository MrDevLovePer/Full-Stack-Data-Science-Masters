    "#### 1) In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be or string and expressions will be mathematical operators. *, 'hello', -87.8, -, /, +\n",

    "#### 2) What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a sequence of one or more characters (letters, numbers, symbols) that can be either a constant or a variable. Made up of Unicode, strings are immutable sequences, meaning they are unchanging.\n",
    "\n",
    "String might be a variable with some specific conditions, variable should not be separated by the spaces, must start with alphabet, and may start with underscore in some specific cases. Moreover varibale is used to asign a value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major visual difference is string is represented by quotes(single/double/triple). The variable is set without quotes with specific conditions as mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Describe three different data types.\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "str: str is a string data type in python, which is immutabe and iterable. In one sentence, string is a sequence of characters.\n",
    "ex: 'sudh', 'ineuron', 'cyberdev', 'f_s_d_s',etc\n",
    "\n",
    "int: int is a integer datatype where it stores integer values, ex: 1, 44, 33, -45, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Float: float can store only floating values such as 233.33, 22.2, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do? \n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators (operands) e.g \n",
    "a = 2 + 3 and expressions are used to evaluate the values or represent the result on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators, and the statement is just like a command that a python interpreter executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6) After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain? \n",
    "    bacon = 22\n",
    "    bacon + 1\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "However bacon+1 gives 23. But,   \n",
    "The variable bacon still contain the value as 22. Since, it was not assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7) What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "    'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "    'spam' * 3\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "spamspamspam\n",
    "spamspamspam\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8) Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "variables should never start with a numeric or integer. It always starts with an alphabet or underscore in some specific cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9) What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "int()\n",
    "float()\n",
    "str()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10) Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "\n",
    "    'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos' \n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language. string and numeric/integer datatype  cannot be concatinated here.\n",
    "Solution is, convert that integer to string by typecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    'I have eaten' + str(99) + 'burritos' \n"
